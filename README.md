Description: Newselle will allow users to view the weather for specific locations, view the top news headlines, and view all recent news articles with a variety of categories ranging from entertainment and health to sports and technology from various different news sources all in one app as opposed to having different apps for different news companies. 

Endpoints:
NewsAPI has 2 Endpoints: 

1. Top Headlines
“This endpoint provides live top and breaking headlines for a country, specific category in a country, single source, or multiple sources. You can also search with keywords. Articles are sorted by the earliest date published first.

This endpoint is great for retrieving headlines for display on news tickers or similar.”
https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines

2. Everything
“Search through millions of articles from over 50,000 large and small news sources and blogs. This includes breaking news as well as lesser articles. 

This endpoint suits article discovery and analysis, but can be used to retrieve articles for display, too.”
