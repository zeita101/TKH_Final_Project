Endpoints:
NewsAPI has 2 Endpoints: 

1. Top Headlines
“This endpoint provides live top and breaking headlines for a country, specific category in a country, single source, or multiple sources. You can also search with keywords. Articles are sorted by the earliest date published first.

This endpoint is great for retrieving headlines for display on news tickers or similar.”
https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines

2. Everything
“Search through millions of articles from over 50,000 large and small news sources and blogs. This includes breaking news as well as lesser articles. 

This endpoint suits article discovery and analysis, but can be used to retrieve articles for display, too.”
